What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Initializing a repository creates the .git file which will allow you to save commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The repository contains a lot of files, the staging area only contains the files we are going to bundle
together in a commit.  It is useful because you might not want to commit
every file in a repository together.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

You can check to see what changes you have made in the version you have staged in order to decide if you want to commit.
You could conceivably also revert your changes after looking at what you have staged in order to make changes and commit separately if
you decided you had too many changes made.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

If you were creating a different version of a program, or you were implementing changes in a program that you were afraid might introduce
a bug.  Being able to still have a working version of a file would be
very useful.
