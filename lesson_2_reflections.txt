What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Initializing a repository creates the .git file which will allow you to save commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The repository contains a lot of files, the staging area only contains the files we are going to bundle
together in a commit.  It is useful because you might not want to commit
every file in a repository together.
